PROJECT TITLE - Diagnosis and prognosis of diseases with deep learning methods

PROJECT DESCRIPTION -

Problem and relevance to today’s needs and market -	In today’s scenario, there are very few radiologists and due to this lack in numbers, they are overloaded with work. Our product aims to assist them to save their time and lessen their workload. Our product will also help the laymen to read and study their own X-ray so that they can inform the doctor about their condition if a radiologist is not available in time. Moreover, people in India seem to belittle the severity of skin diseases. Our product will diagnose the skin diseases and chest diseases and inform the patient about the severity of the disease so that he/she can take the required precautions/treatment in time. As there is requirement of system which can help doctors in diagnosing patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments.

Solution to the problem -	Here we aim to develop a system based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Random-forest algorithm for recognition of input X-ray or image of infected skin for diagnosis. Transfer learning method can be applied on pretrained CNN for higher accuracy and reliability. These networks are effective in image recognition. System will also ask for symptoms, based on processed input image for accurate diagnosis and if not finds any disease then it will make prognosis based on inputs of symptoms. Moreover, if it finds any normal rash or bruise it will also predict for relevant medicines and precautions. This system can be a product in form of an app or web application.

Description of solution and how it is innovative -	Since CNN are basic building blocks in image recognition technique but requires large dataset for training so we will use transfer learning with pretrained CNN model Densenet-121 which is trained on millions of images. We will freeze its initial layers for usual mathematical computation and replace its last and output layers with our dataset for accurate diagnosis. It is unique as after processing of input image system will ask for relevant symptoms on its own for more accuracy.
Additionally, if it does not find any fatal disease then it will prognosis for disease based on input. If output is not a severe disease than it will predict some common medicines and precautions. System can diagnose and prognose Cancer and Corona disease too. This system can be built-in an app for easy access to everyone.

Feasibility of solution  -	This system can diagnose disease of chest such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, Edema etc. and skin diseases such as skin cancer, rashes etc.by just inputting an image of infected skin or chest X ray with high accuracy and reliability. It can also prognosis based on symptoms and image provided by user. This is easy to access through an app. This system can detect cancer and corona disease too because of its flexibility to accept coming threats in terms of diseases. This system can also predict some common medicines and precautions against if any common disease is detected. 
To achieve the prototype development, we need a good computer system with AI framework to write down and processing of CNN, decision tree and a random forest algorithm. We must develop an app for ease in access which is also a computer work. These all resources are easily available.

Applicability of solution	 - This innovation is highly effective in almost all areas as diseases are natural. This system makes it easy to get diagnosis every day. Additional feature of prognosis is highly effective in every domain. This system is useful in areas where daily check-ups are not feasible, and it supports the economic circumstances.
This innovation is more economical than other alternates for same problem as it does not require a lot of hardware and reliable against such solutions. It is financially viable to install this system in real world application.
This concept is environment friendly as it does not require many hardware accessories for implementation in real world. Moreover, it does not affect environment directly or indirectly.
